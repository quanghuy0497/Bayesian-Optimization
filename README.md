# Bayesian Optimization

A simple implementation code of [**Bayesian Optimization**](https://bayesoptbook.com) (BayesOpt) on NumPy and SciPy with Gaussian Process as the surrogate model and Expected Improvement as acquisition function for black-box optimization.

The main idea of the algorithm is to build a *statistical surrogate model* (distribution over function) and sample more data via a *cheap-optimized acquisition function* to update itself via Bayesian theorem, thus locating the global optimum of the black-box function.
